A magnetic substance, such as iron, steel, nickel and cobalt, is attracted to a magnet when placed in the magnet's magnetic field. A magnetic field is a space around a magnet in which a magnetic substance or another magnet experiences a force. \nThe magnetic field of a bar magnet has a specific shape that can be seen if iron filings are sprinkled around the magnet. The shape of the magnetic field can be represented by field lines. The direction of a magnetic field is from the N-pole to the S-pole.\nThe N-pole of one magnet will repel another magnet's N-pole. Similarly, the S-poles of two magnets will repel each other. The N-pole of one magnet will attract the S-pole of another magnet.\nThere is a magnetic field around the Earth that has the same shape as the magnetic field of a bar magnet. The direction of the field is also from the North pole to the South pole. Any magnetic substance or magnet will experience a force in the magnetic field of the Earth.", "title": "MAGNETC FORCES", "instruction": "Well done on completing this subtopic!
