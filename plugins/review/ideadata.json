        "summary": "The gravitational force that the Earth exerts on an object is called gravity. The Earth's gravity causes objects to accelerate to its centre. This is called gravitational acceleration.`The greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational force of attraction between them. The closer the objects are to each other, the stronger the gravitational force between them. `The gravitational force is directly proportional to the masses of the objects and indirectly proportional to the distance between them.Mass is the amount of matter in an object and is measured in grams or kilograms. It is the same at any location. Weight is the attraction of the Earth on an object. It is a force and is measured in newtons. An object's weight varies from place to place.`Weight (w) is calculated by multiplying an object's mass (m) by the gravitational acceleration (g): w = m x g, where g = 9.8 m.s-1. The weight of a person with a mass of 45kg is: w = m x g\n= 45 x 9.8   \n= 441N  ",
