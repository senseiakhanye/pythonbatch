This introduces the subject and purpose of the speech using persuasive appeal.  The introduction could be an anecdote, a fact, a rhetorical question, an interesting quotation, a question, a provocative statement, or just a few sentences of description. The goal is to orient your listener.\nFrederick Douglass uses rhetorical questions in his    \n introduction to get the audience to question the inequalities   \n in America: “Fellow citizens, pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here today? What have I or those I represent to do with your national independence?”\n\n\n"}, {"point": "Statement of Fact", "heading": "Explanation of Statement of Fact", "description": "The narrative or statement of fact is called the 'narratio' in Latin.  The goal of the the statement of fact is to provide enough background information for your audience to understand the context of your argument. It summarises the main issues.\n:The background information provided here is the fact that Independence Day is for white people because black people are still kept as slaves. As a result of this, they can't celebrate their independence. He, therefore, refuses to celebrate this day as it highlights the inequalities in American society.\n“I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak today? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you, that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation (Babylon) whose crimes, towering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin.” \n\n\n\n"}, {"point": "Arguments", "heading": "Explanation of Arguments", "description": "Arguments are called 'confirmatio' in Latin. It means “strengthen.” This is the main body of your speech where you provide proof or confirmation to support and strengthen your claims.\nDouglass strengthens his argument by pointing out the fact that millions of black people are still slaves and that their children are slaves too. Therefore, if he celebrated with white people today, he would be betraying them as they don't have their freedom like white people do. He questions the integrity of a nation who would allow that. \n\n“Fellow citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions, whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are today rendered more intolerable by the jubilant shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, \"may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\"\nTo forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs and to chime in with the popular theme would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the world. \nMy subject, then, fellow citizens, is \"American Slavery.\" I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave's point of view. Standing here, identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this Fourth of July.”\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"point": "Counter Arguments", "heading": "Explanation of Counter Arguments", "description": "The counter arguments are called the 'refutatio.' This covers the counter-arguments that possible opponents may have and seeks to destroy them in the most elegant way possible.\nThe counter-argument in this speech would be that slaves should not be treated equally because they are not human. The law and slave-holders treat them like humans though, because when they commit crimes, they receive the same punishment as the white man does. This therefore proves they are human and deserve to be treated as such.\n“Would you argue more and denounce less, would you persuade more and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slave-holders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They acknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of these same crimes will subject a white man to like punishment.”\n\n\n\n"}, {"point": "Conclusion\n \n\n\n\n\n", "heading": "Explanation of Conclusion", "description": "The conclusion is called the 'peroratio' in Latin. It means the “completion.”  It includes your closing argument. The peroration sums up the speech and uses emotion to appeal to the audience. It needs to be thought-provoking.\nDouglass points out that people can't really believe that God supports slavery because that goes against the whole idea that God is better than humans. God is aware that slavery is terrible, while some humans just haven't evolved to that level of thinking yet. Getting Americans to agree that God did not approve of for slavery was an excellent conclusion, as he was appealing to their moral/value system and questioning how devoted they were to God and what He stands for.\n“What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman cannot be divine. Who can reason on such a proposition? They that can, may - I cannot. The time for such argument is past.”\n\n\n"}]}}
